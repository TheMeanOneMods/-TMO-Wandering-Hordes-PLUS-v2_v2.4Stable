# -TMO-Wandering-Hordes-PLUS-v2_v2.4Stable

Take your apocalypse up a notch.
This server-side mod overhauls wandering hordes in 7 Days to Die, making them larger, scarier, and fully customizable.

🔥 Features
Custom Horde Sizes → Control min/max zombies with an easy XML config. Look for WanderingHordePlus.xml
Adjustable Frequency → Define how often hordes appear (in-game hours). Want em every 2 - 3 hours? Go for it!
Great Logging → Color-coded console messages so you never miss the action. You will also see the number spawning, where they spawn and the pretty pink color for my prefix.
Server-Friendly → Works with EAC enabled, no client-side install required.

Dependencies/Requirements → TMO Core is Required for this to work. ServerSide Only!
Fully Overrides the Gamestages.XML to ensure Maximum Efficiency. 

Initial Hordes may take 24 Hours to Spawn as its some weirdness the game does.
﻿﻿Configuration Example:  (I preset this for my liking, if you delete it however, the values will be less).

================================
<WanderingHordesPLUS>
  <!-- Minimum zombies per wandering horde -->
  <MinZombies>15</MinZombies>
  <!-- Maximum zombies per wandering horde -->
  <MaxZombies>25</MaxZombies>
  <!-- Minimum in-game hours between hordes -->
  <MinHours>4</MinHours>
  <!-- Maximum in-game hours between hordes -->
  <MaxHours>8</MaxHours>
</WanderingHordesPLUS>
================================

(Caution, a maximum number that is too high can seriously impact server performance. I tested as high as 59 zombies, and had no issues. Not all Server Hosts are Created Equally, and not all PCs are either.)
